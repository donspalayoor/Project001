# **Summary Report**

**1. Introduction**

DataCo has commissioned the development of a real-time data pipeline for ingesting, processing, and indexing clickstream data from a web application. The goal is to gain insights into user engagement, and this report outlines the approach taken and assumptions made in implementing the data pipeline.

**2. Approach**

The data pipeline was designed in four main stages:

2.1 Ingest clickstream data from Kafka
2.2 Store the ingested data in the chosen data store with a defined schema
2.3 Periodically process the stored clickstream data in the data store
2.4 Index the processed data in Elasticsearch

**3. Tools and technologies**

We used the following tools and technologies to build the data pipeline:

- Apache Kafka for data ingestion
- Apache HBase as the data store
- Apache Spark for data processing and aggregation
- Elasticsearch for data indexing and searching

**4. Implementation**

4.1 Ingesting data from Kafka

We used Apache Kafka for ingesting clickstream data in real-time. Kafka producers were set up to publish clickstream data to a Kafka topic, and a Kafka consumer was implemented to consume and process data from this topic.

4.2 Storing ingested data in HBase

After ingesting the data from Kafka, we stored the data in Apache HBase, a NoSQL database that supports high throughput and low latency operations at scale. The data was stored using the provided schema: row key, click_data, geo_data, and user_agent_data.

4.3 Processing the stored clickstream data

Apache Spark was used to periodically process the stored data in HBase. We used Spark Streaming to read data from HBase in real-time and performed the necessary aggregations and calculations on the clickstream data, as specified such as the number of clicks, unique users, and average time spent on each URL by users from each country.

4.4 Indexing processed data in Elasticsearch

Elasticsearch was used to store and index the processed data obtained from Spark. This enabled searching, analyzing, and visualizing the clickstream data in real-time using Elasticsearchâ€™s powerful querying capabilities and Kibana for visualization.

**5. Assumptions**

We made the following assumptions during the implementation of the data pipeline:

- Clickstream data has a known structure that adheres to the provided schema
- There is no need for data anonymization or encryption during processing
- The data pipeline is expected to handle an ever-increasing volume of clickstream data with minimal      latency and overhead. 
- Data is  continuously send from Kafka Producer to Kafka Consumer
- All the necessary packages used in the code are preinstalled
- These are below configuration for Kafka, HBase and Elastic Search
    
    Kafka consumer configuration
      
      KAFKA_TOPIC = 'clickstream'
      
      KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS = 'localhost:9092'
    
    
    HBase configuration
      
      HBASE_HOST = 'localhost'
      
      HBASE_TABLE_NAME = 'clickstream_data'
    
    
    Elasticsearch configuration
      
      ES_HOST = 'localhost'
      
      ES_PORT = 9200
      
      ES_INDEX_NAME = 'processed_clickstream_data'


**6. Conclusion**

We have successfully developed a real-time data pipeline that ingests, processes, and indexes clickstream data as per the given requirements. The data pipeline is efficient, scalable, and built using industry-standard tools and technologies.

The implementation of the data pipeline meets the requirements set forth by DataCo, and the provided code is readable and maintainable to ensure ease of future updates and enhancements. The report provides a comprehensive overview of the approach and assumptions made during the development process.
